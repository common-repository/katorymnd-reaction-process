2. Search for **Katorymnd Reaction Process** or **Katorymnd** and click *Install Now*.
3. Once installed, click 'Activate Plugin' to start using it on your site.

For theme developers:
- To embed the feedback form in posts/pages, use the shortcode: `[katorymnd_feedback]` or insert the PHP code `<?php echo do_shortcode('[katorymnd_feedback]'); ?>` in your template files.
- To integrate the rating system (Star or Slider) on your pages, use the shortcode: `[katorymnd_rating]` or insert the PHP code `<?php echo do_shortcode('[katorymnd_rating]'); ?>` in your template files.

This approach allows you to display either the feedback form or the chosen rating form (Star Rating or Slider Rating) anywhere on your site, based on the current configurations set in the plugin's Settings Configuration area.
